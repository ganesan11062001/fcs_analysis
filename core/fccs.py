core/fccs.py — FCCS bound-fraction (amplitude-ratio) calculation.

Standard formalism (Bacia & Schwille): for red/green channels with cross-correlation
amplitude Gx(0) and autocorrelation amplitudes G_r(0), G_g(0):
    Gx(0) = N_rg / (N_r * N_g)         (N_rg = number of doubly-labeled complexes)
    G_r(0) = 1/N_r,  G_g(0) = 1/N_g
=>  fraction of red-labeled molecules bound to green  = N_rg/N_r = Gx(0) / G_g(0)
    fraction of green-labeled molecules bound to red  = N_rg/N_g = Gx(0) / G_r(0)

i.e. bound fraction of a channel = Gx(0) / G(other channel)(0).

No spectral crosstalk / bleed-through correction is applied in this version (by
project decision) -- this is the uncorrected amplitude-ratio formula.
