1. **Load** — your CSV's time column + 1 or 2 intensity columns are read in.
2. **Trim the time window** — cut out any bad stretch of the acquisition (laser drift,
   focus loss); the kept region is shaded on the raw trace plot.
3. **Bin points** *(optional)* — group N consecutive raw samples together before
   correlating, to reduce shot noise. Leave at 1 to skip this.
4. **Run the multi-tau correlation** — computes G(τ) for each channel (and the
   cross-correlation, if dual-channel) on a log-spaced lag grid.
5. **Fit a diffusion model** — choose 1 or 2 diffusing species (and an optional
   triplet/blinking term) per channel, independently; get back τ_D and amplitude, with a
   multi-start stability check that flags unstable/degenerate fits rather than silently
   accepting them.
6. **FCCS bound fraction** *(dual-channel only)* — combines the three fitted amplitudes
   into the fraction of each species that's bound to the other.

Every stage is CSV-exportable. See **Methodology** in the sidebar for the exact formula
behind each step.
